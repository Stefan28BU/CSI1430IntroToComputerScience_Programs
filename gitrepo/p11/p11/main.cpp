 * Assignment Title:       Guessing Game
 * Assignment Description: This assignment reqiures us to write a C++ program
                           to let the user try to guess the correct number that
                           randomly selected by the computer

/*
 * Data Abstraction:
 *            Two integers are entered into the program that are upper number
 *                  and lower number, and the system automatically selected a 
 *                  random number (lowerI, upperI, n)
 * Input:
 *            Two integers entered by the user in order to form a region of
 *                  random numbers, then the user need to enter a integer
 *                  which is the number guessed by the user (lowerI, upperI, n)
 * Process:
 *            After the time that the two integers are entered, the program
 *                  will then randomly selected serious of integers based on
 *                  the biggest number and the lowset number entered by the
 *                  user, and then the program will ask the user to guess the
 *                  selected integer within the region. If the number entered
 *                  is too high or too low, the program will display the
 *                  relavent suggestion to the user in order to make the user
 *                  select the correct number, if the number is correct, the
 *                  program will tell you and display the number of tries on 
 *                  the screen
 * Output:
 *           The program will tell the user has already entered a correct
 *                  number that is seclected by the system and then display
 *                  the number of tries done by the user
 * Assumptions:
 *           It is assumed that, having been prompted to do so, the user will 
 *                  correctly input data within that region

//in testing this program, if I entered the number 35, 40, the program will
//display "I'm thinking of a number between 35 and 40 inclusive.". However,
//when I tested my program on the upload site, it displayed "I'm thinking of a
//number between 40 and 35 inclusive.". Then the following line is just infinite
//tries to guess the number and ever ended, and I don't know why that happens.
//So, if that is not my problem, hopefully my grade won't be cut critically.
//If it is my problem, I would like to know why.
//Thanks a lot!
